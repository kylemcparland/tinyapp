# TinyApp Project - By: Kyle McParland (Lighthouse Labs 2024)

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This simple multi-page app has the following feature highlights:
1. **Account registry** [ User logins, personal user databases ]
2. **Authentication protection** [ Hashed passwords, encrypted cookies ] 
3. **Server client** [ Express ]
4. **CRUD simple entities** [ Custom URL shortening function: submit URLs + edit/delete them from your protected database ]
5. **Pages displayed with HTML** [ ejs ]

Server hosted locally on ***PORT 8080*** using express!

## Installation

- Clone **[TinyApp]** using the SSH key in the git repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kylemcparland/tinyapp.git
cd tinyapp/
```

- Install dependencies using _npm install_ ( full list documented on bottom of README.md ):

```bash
npm install
```

_--- => Installation complete!_

## How to use
- Initialize the development web server using `npm start` or simply the `node express_server.js` command.
```bash
npm start
...
"TinyApp listening on port 8080!"
```
- Connect locally using "localhost:8080" in your browser! _(Or customize the host using the PORT variable stored in express_server.js):_
